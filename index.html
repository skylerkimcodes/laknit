            LA KNIT is based in Los Angeles, California, at the heart of the U.S. fashion industry. While fabric
            production exists
            worldwide, LA KNIT recognized early on the growing need for domestic manufacturing. In today’s fast-moving
            fashion
            market, local production offers unmatched speed, flexibility, and reliability.

            We work with a wide range of yarns and employ advanced knitting and dyeing techniques, supported by a team
            of highly
            skilled technicians whose expertise rivals manufacturers anywhere in the world. Our competitive advantage
            lies in fast
            turnaround times and consistently high quality.

            Looking to start a clothing line with low minimum quantities? LA KNIT specializes in supporting small
            businesses,
            startups, and emerging designers. We help bring your ideas to life through design consultation, pattern
            making, and
            customized apparel production packages tailored to your needs.

            LA KNIT sets itself apart through deep experience in both manufacturing and distribution, a hands-on
            ownership approach,
            and a consultative sales style focused on long-term partnerships. Most of our fabrics are produced in the
            USA using
            imported yarns from Asia or Mexico, giving customers greater flexibility in specifications, colors, and
            finishes. This
            flexibility can make the difference between setting a trend and chasing one.
